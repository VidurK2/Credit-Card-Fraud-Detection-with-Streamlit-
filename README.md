# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-Streamlit-
I have designed a credit card fraud detection program using two datasets and several modules, one of which is Streamlit. 

For my annual school project, I decided to design a fradulant transaction detector. I haven't deployed this program anywhere, however it is a working model containing 3 classifiers

P.S:
You will need to download 2 datasets for certain modules for this program to work
